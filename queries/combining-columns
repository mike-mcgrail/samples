//you want to combine two columns into a single column for use. for example, you have two columns that both track urls. one is called domain, the other called sni

//start with your initial search. for exmaple
dataSource.vendor='Sophos' event.type='Content Filtering'
//this will return sophos filtering logs, but for some reason some times the url is in domain field, sometimes in sni field

// we can combine with the let command

  | let myURL = domain + sni

  // this combines the two rows. in my case, one or the other was null, so it just reults in having a single field that works
