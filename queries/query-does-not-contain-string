Use Case: Create a query that returns all values that do not contain a certain string

Logic will be of form 

not ($field$ matches $regex$)

specific example: search for login events where username does not end in "$". This would be for something like excluding service accounts from a query


query:

event.type='Login' and not (event.login.userName matches '[\\$]$')

first we filter to only event type of login, then we match based on the username field


'[\\$]$'
this is a regex pattern looking for the '$' character at the end of the field

then we match all logs that fit this regex pattern in the field "event.login.userName"

finally we use not (...) to discard all logs that match the query
