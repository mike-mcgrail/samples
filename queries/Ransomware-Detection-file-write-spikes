///in order of lines
///line 1: finds file modification events in S1 EDR telemetry
////line 2: groups all file modifications by the source process, then calculates the max, average, and standard deviation of number of file modifications for each source process in a 1 hour time period. It also tracks the number of entries (more entries = more accurate)
////line 3: creates a new variable for each source process, called upperBound, which takes the average file modifications in 1 hour by that source process and adds 4 standard deviations to that to find the max amount we would consider normal
///line 4: creates a new boolean variable that compares the max 1 hour count of file modifications by a source process to the upperBound. this is true only if we have enough data points (20) for the findings to be significant (false positive reduction)
///line 5: filters to only results where the boolean in line 4 evaluates as true
