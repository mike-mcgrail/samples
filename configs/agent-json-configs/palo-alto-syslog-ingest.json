// Configuration for the Scalyr Agent. For help:
//
// https://www.scalyr.com/help/scalyr-agent-2

// ::::::::::::HOW TO USE THIS FILE :::::::::::::::::: 
// this file is intended to work as a sample configuration file to accept incoming syslogs from Palo Alto Firewalls on TCP/601 or UDP/514, tag it with the marketpalce parser name
// and then forward to the most common SDL endpoint for S1 customers, which is https://xdr.us1.sentinelone.net

//::::important note... you may not be able to just copy and paste this into your config file, you may have to manually type a lot of it. CLI file interpretters can be picky and throw JSON
//errors if you try to copy the whole thing in

//prep work or checklist
//1. log into your S1 tenant, open up the Singularity Data Lake view, and inspect the URL. if it is not xdr.us1.sentinelone.net/events....... then you need to replace the scalyr_server field
// below with the correct url

//2. From the SDL view, select your username in the top right corner, and click API keys from the drop down. Create a log write key and copy it. place it in the API key field below

//3. if you would to be able to easily differentiate which syslog server host a log passed through (STRONGLY ENCOURAGED FOR TROUBLESHOOTING PURPOSES) record the hostname of the server
//that you will install the scalyr agent on in the serverHost field below

//4. install the marketplace palo alto integration (from the main S1 interface, click "marketplace, search for palo alto firewall, and install the integration
// this will create a parser in your tenant which matches the parser name in the monitors config below
// if you are trying to configure any other data source for ingestion (not palo alto firewall logs) then I recommend you find the right parser, install it in your tenant, and then replace
// the parser name in the monitor config below
